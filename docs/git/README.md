### Commitizen

First of all, we are using [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen) for conventional naming of commits. [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) prevents incorret commit name. Commitizen installed locally, so to commit you should use the existing script command:

```bash
yarn cz
```

### Branches
